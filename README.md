# Magic Eight Ball

## General Requirements

  * prompt the user to ask whether he wants to ask a question and return a randomly selected answer.
  * allow the user to continue to ask questions by implementing a loop that ask the user whether he wants to ask another question.

First, get your program working with a single question/answer. Then add the ability to ask repeated questions until the user decides he no longer wants to plan.

## Step 1 - Create an array to store the possible answers.

	Seems unlikely.
	Not a chance.
	In your dreams.
	Get real, kid.
	Absolutely.
	Maybe.
	It is certain.
	Ask me later.
	Chances seem good.
	I don\'t know, I\'m just a stupid piece of plastic.
	Ask again later.
	Signs point to yes.
	No.
	Yes.
	Nope.
	Don\'t count on it.
	Is the Pope Catholic?
	Does a one legged duck swim in a circle?

  ## Step 2 - Prompt the user for a question and store the answer in a variable.

  
"What would you like to know today?"

  ## Step 3 - Use the Math.random method to pick one of the answers from you array of answers and write that answer to the console log.

  Here is a [resource](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/appendices/math-method-examples/random-examples.html#random-examples) on the Math.random method.

  ## Step 4 - Add a loop to continue to ask if the user wants to ask another question and exit the loop when he cancels.

  What kind of loop works best for when you want to continue until a condition is no longer true?
